      "Paper Text: job protection deregulation in good and bad times this paper explores the shortterm employment effect of deregulating job protection for regular workers and how it varies with prevailing business cycle conditions we apply the local projection method to a newly constructed dataset of major regular job protection reforms covering 26 advanced economies over the past four decades the analysis relies on countrysectorlevel data using as identifying assumption the fact that stringent dismissal regulations are more binding in sectors that are characterized by a higher natural propensity to make regular adjustments to the workforce we find that the response of sectoral employment to deregulation depends crucially on the state of the economy at the time of reformderegulation increases employment if implemented during an economic expansion but reduces employment if carried out in a recession these findings are consistent with theory and are robust to a battery of sensitivity checks\n",

      "Paper Text: csr and local conflicts in african mining communities  onequarter of mining operations in africa face social conflicts in nearby communities  this paper analyses the impact of corporate social responsibility csr spending on conflict  the higher the risk of conflict the more likely it is that companies engage in csr spending  at least in the short term this functional use of csr reduces the occurrence of conflict  the conflictreducing effect of csr does not exceed the high conflict risk before csr started abstract recent research finds that the opening of mines in africa increases the risk of local protests and conflict however few empirical studies have analysed the effect of corporate social responsibility csr of mining companies on conflicts in extraction areas this study investigates the relationship between csr payments and conflicts in african mining communities using econometric techniques we create and explore a large dataset on csr payments by 292 mining companies across 17 african countries and eight years our study finds that mining companies are more likely to engage in csr activities when they are exposed to conflict in their areas of operation in previous years once conducted csr activities attenuate tensions however csr does not lead to lower levels of conflict than in mining areas that have never received any csr the latter might be less in need of csr to manage operational risks in the first place these findings support the view that mining companies engage in csr activities to counter operational risks associated with local conflict but that the effects are moderate\n",

      "Paper Text: regional allocation of co2 emissions allowance over provinces in china by 2020 abstract the mitigation efforts of china are increasingly important for meeting global climate target since the rapid economic growth of china has led to an increasing share in the worlds total co2 emissions this paper sets out to explore the approach for realizing chinas national mitigation targets submitted to the unfccc as part of the copenhagen accord that is to reduce the intensity of co2 emissions per unit of gdp by 4045 by 2020 as well as reducing the energy intensity and increasing the share of nonfossil fuel consumption through regional allocation of emission allowance over chinas provinces since the realization of chinas mitigation target essentially represents a total amount emission allowance allocation problem an improved zero sum gains data envelopment analysis optimization model which could deal with the constant total amount resources allocation is proposed in this study by utilizing this model and based on several scenarios of chinas economic growth co2 emissions and energy consumption a new efficient emission allowance allocation scheme on provincial level for china by 2020 is proposed the allocation results indicate that different provinces have to shoulder different mitigation burdens in terms of emission intensity reduction energy intensity reduction and share of nonfossil fuels increase  we explore the approach to realize national co2 emissions reduction target of china by 2020  the co2 emissions allowance is allocated over chinas 30 administrative regions  several scenarios of chinas regional economy emission energy consumption are given  the zero sum gains data envelopment analysis model is applied in emission allowance allocation  an efficient emission allowance allocation scheme on provincial level is proposed\n",

      "Paper Text: optimal provision of public goods a synthesis the standard approach to the optimal provision of public goods highlights the importance of distortionary taxation and distributional concerns a new approach neutralizes distributional concerns by adjusting the income tax schedule we demonstrate that both approaches are derived from the same basic formula we also take the new approach further by deriving an intuitive formula for the optimal level of public goods without imposing strong assumptions on preferences this formula shows that distortionary taxation has a role to play as in the standard approach however the main determinants of optimal provision are different and the modified samuelson rule is likely to lead to underprovision\n",
